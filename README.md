# React-Todo

We're going to practice building a stateful class component with this project. Even though hooks are gaining popularity among react developers, class components are going to be around for a long time. It's imperative that you get use to class components, and feel comfortable working with class components since you'll most likely need to work with them if you are hired to work on a React app.

## Dependencies & Files

- prettier(developer)
- styled components (ui)


## 1.) TodoForm.js
-  Create a function that takes in  'props'
- Build a form with an input field and 2 buttons
**onChange & onClick**
onChange will handle the updates that occur within the input field.
onClick will launch the function passed into it. In this case those functions are 'handleAddTodo' and 'handleClearTodos' what they do is stored in the app.js component. Note: these are destructured!!


#### 2.) App.js
This is the component that our state is stored in. Call  `constructor` & `super` and then pass in how we would like our state sestup here we are passing in an array of todos and an key value todo. I passed in 2 'test' todo items to the array and then left the value as an empty string to store our input data we will get from the form.
